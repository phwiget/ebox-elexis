# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ConfigFile
# ~~~~~
# Play uses HOCON as its configuration file format.  HOCON has a number
# of advantages over other config formats, but there are two things that
# can be used when modifying settings.
#
# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:
#include "extra-config.conf"
#
# You can declare variables and substitute for them:
#mykey = ${some.value}
#
# And if an environment variable exists when there is no other subsitution, then
# HOCON will fall back to substituting environment variable:
#mykey = ${JAVA_HOME}

## Akka
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaAkka#Configuration
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaAkka#Configuration
# ~~~~~
# Play uses Akka internally and exposes Akka Streams and actors in Websockets and
# other streaming HTTP responses.
akka {
  # "akka.log-config-on-start" is extraordinarly useful because it log the complete
  # configuration at INFO level, including defaults and overrides, so it s worth
  # putting at the very top.
  #
  # Put the following in your conf/logback.xml file:
  #
  # <logger name="akka.actor" level="INFO" />
  #
  # And then uncomment this line to debug the configuration.
  #
  #log-config-on-start = true
}

## Secret key
# http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret

# The secret key is used to sign Play's session cookie.
# This must be changed for production, but we don't recommend you change it in this file.
play.crypto.secret = "changeme"
